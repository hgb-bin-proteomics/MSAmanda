# MS Amanda

**MS Amanda** is a scoring system to identify peptides out of tandem mass spectrometry data using a database of known proteins.

The MS Amanda algorithm is especially designed for high resolution and high accuracy tandem mass spectra. One advantage of MS Amanda is the high
speed of spectrum identification, especially since MS Amanda 2.0. In addition, MS Amanda is also very accurate, as we observe a high overlap of
identified spectra with gold-standard algorithms Mascot and SEQUEST.
